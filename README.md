## What is Next Door?

Next Door is a small, private community app you can run for the people right around you: an apartment building, a single street, or a local group. It gives a neighbourhood one calm place to chat, plan events, and pass things along to each other, without ads, tracking, or a giant public social network in the middle.

You host your own copy. The data lives in your own database. Members sign in with Google, and the first admin decides who gets in.

> **Heads up:** this repository is currently a **Product Demo**. The live site is a working demonstration with sample data that resets from time to time, so feel free to click around and break things.

---

## Try the live demo

Visit **[nextdoor.deeproduct.org](https://nextdoor.deeproduct.org)** and pick either option:

- **Guest Access** drops you straight into the app as a temporary visitor. No account, no Google, nothing to fill in. Guest sessions are cleared automatically.
- **Sign in with Google** gives you a full member account with a profile.

Because it is a shared demo, the data is wiped on a schedule. Anything you post is temporary by design.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Database and Auth | Supabase (Postgres, Realtime, Storage) |
| Language | TypeScript 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 |

| Scheduling | cron-job.org (webhook based) |
| Deployment | Vercel |

---

## Run your own

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project (the free tier is plenty)
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account (free tier works)
- A [Resend](https://resend.com/) account for email (optional, free tier works)
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth 2.0 credentials

### 1. Clone and install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepakkrishnar1618-svg/Next-Door-App.git
cd Next-Door-App
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1. Create a new Supabase project.
2. Open the SQL Editor and run `supabase/schema.sql` to create every table.
3. Run `supabase/add-guest-support.sql` to enable Guest Access (it adds the `is_guest` column).
4. Seed the default settings:

```sql
INSERT INTO app_settings (setting_key, setting_value) VALUES
  ('email_notifications_enabled', '1'),
  ('email_send_days', '["monday"]'),
  ('email_send_time', '09:00'),
  ('email_last_sent', '')
ON CONFLICT (setting_key) DO NOTHING;
```

5. In Authentication, Providers, enable **Google** and paste in your Google OAuth Client ID and Secret.
6. To allow Guest Access, enable **Anonymous sign ins** under Authentication, Sign In / Providers.
7. Add your app URL under Authentication, URL Configuration, Redirect URLs.

### 3. Configure Google OAuth

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), APIs and Services, Credentials.
2. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID for a Web application.
3. Add your Supabase callback as an authorised redirect URI: `https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.

### 4. Environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase, Settings, API |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase, Settings, API |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase, Settings, API (keep this secret, server only) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Your deployment URL |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | The Google email that becomes admin on first sign in |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend, API Keys |
| `CRON_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Any long random string, used to authenticate cron webhooks |

When you deploy to Vercel, store the three secret values (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CRON_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) as **Sensitive** environment variables.

### 5. Deploy to Vercel

```sh
npx vercel
```

Or connect the repository in the Vercel dashboard and add the environment variables there.

### 6. Set up the cron jobs (optional)

These keep the app tidy. Create three jobs at [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org), each sending the header `x-webhook-secret: <your CRON_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`:

| Job | URL | Schedule | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cleanup | `https://your-domain.com/api/cron/cleanup` | Every 15 min | POST |
| Email digest | `https://your-domain.com/api/cron` | Every 15 min | POST |
| Purge guests | `https://your-domain.com/api/cron/purge-guests` | Once a day | POST |

The email digest handler checks the admin schedule internally, so running it every 15 minutes is safe. Purge guests removes Guest Access accounts older than `GUEST_TTL_HOURS` (default 24).

---

## Local development

```sh
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`. You will need a Supabase project and a `.env.local` with real credentials.

---

## First sign in

1. Open the app and click **Sign in with Google**.
2. Use the email you set as `ADMIN_EMAIL`.
3. Complete the profile setup (name and room number).
4. You land in the main chat as an admin. Open Settings to configure the app.

---

## Project status

This is the **Product Demo** release. It is feature complete for a single neighbourhood and runs as a live demonstration at [nextdoor.deeproduct.org](https://nextdoor.deeproduct.org). Sample data resets periodically.

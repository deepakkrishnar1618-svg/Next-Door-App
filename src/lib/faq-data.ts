    question: "How do I deploy this app for my neighborhood?",

    question: "How does the app protect my privacy?",
    answer: "Next Door is fully private. We do not track your location, read your messages, or sell your personal details. All chats, listings, and event data are stored on your own self-hosted Supabase database."

    answer: "All uploaded photos, document attachments, and user avatars are stored securely in your private Supabase Storage buckets under strict access control rules."
